Quorum Protocol:

(1) A quorum consists of (2N+1) servers;
(2) The (2N+1) servers run Raft protocol and has a master server M;
(3) Each server i can append new record to a log file, and assign
    that record a consecutive sequence number S[i]. On each server,
    the sequence number is monitonically increasing.

During write:
(1) A writer appends a record R to P servers where (P >= N + 1);
(2) The master server M is periodically polling new records from other
    servers. It will find out that record R has P (P >= N + 1) occurance
    and should be committed.
(3) The master M committed R through Raft protocol, along with
    the latest sequence numbers on each of the server {S[0], ..., S[2N]}
